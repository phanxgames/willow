Willow is a **retained-mode** 2D game framework built on [Ebitengine](https://ebitengine.org/) for Go. You build a tree of nodes — sprites, text, particles, meshes — and Willow traverses that tree each frame to produce optimized render commands for Ebitengine. You describe *what* to render by building a scene tree, not *how* to render by issuing draw commands yourself.

```
Your Game             - gameplay, content, logic
Willow                - scene graph, rendering, interaction
Ebitengine            - GPU backend, window, audio, platform
```

## Key Features

- **Scene graph** — tree of nodes with parent-child transforms, visibility, and render ordering
- **Sprites & atlas** — TexturePacker JSON loading, automatic batching
- **Camera & viewport** — follow, scroll-to, zoom, culling, multi-camera
- **Text** — bitmap fonts and TTF rendering
- **Input** — hit testing, click/drag/pinch gestures with typed callbacks
- **Particles** — CPU-simulated emitters with pooled allocation
- **Tweens & animation** — frame sequences, easing via gween
- **Filters** — Kage shader post-processing (blur, glow, color grading)
- **Meshes** — custom vertex geometry, ropes, polygons
- **Tilemaps** — viewport-based tile rendering
- **Lighting** — 2D light layer compositing
- **Caching** — `CacheAsTree` and `CacheAsTexture` for static content
- **ECS adapter** — optional Entity Component System integration

## How It Works

You own the game loop. Create a `Scene`, call `scene.Update()` and `scene.Draw(screen)` from your Ebitengine game, and Willow handles everything else:

1. **`scene.Update()`** — processes input, fires callbacks, updates particles/tweens, recomputes dirty transforms
2. **`scene.Draw(screen)`** — traverses the tree, culls off-screen nodes, emits and sorts render commands, submits to Ebitengine

The `willow.Run()` helper wraps this into a one-liner for simple projects, but it's a convenience — not a requirement.

## Performance Targets

Willow targets **10,000+ sprites at 120+ FPS** on desktop and **60+ FPS** on mobile with zero heap allocations per frame on the hot path.

## Etymology

Willow's scene graph was inspired by [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/). Pixies are associated with wisps — glowing sprites of light. A display tree full of wisps? That's a willow tree.
